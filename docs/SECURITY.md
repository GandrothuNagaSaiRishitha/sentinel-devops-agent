## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Do NOT Create Public Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public GitHub issue**. Public disclosure can put users at risk.

### Report Responsibly

1. **Email the maintainers** at:
   - `SKfaizan-786@gmail.com` (Core Team)
   - Include: "SECURITY" in subject line

2. **Provide details:**
   - Description of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Affected components
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

3. **Timeline:**
   - We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
   - Updates provided every 7 days
   - Target fix timeline: 30 days for critical, 60 for others

### Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will:
- ✅ Acknowledge your report promptly
- ✅ Work on a fix in confidential branch
- ✅ Credit you in security advisory (optional)
- ✅ Release patch update
- ✅ Notify users of critical issues

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices for Users

### For Production Deployments

1. **Use HTTPS**
   ```bash
   # Configure reverse proxy (Nginx/HAProxy)
   # Redirect all HTTP to HTTPS
   ```

2. **Implement Authentication**
   ```javascript
   // Add JWT validation to backend
   // Require API keys for endpoints
   ```

3. **Enable RBAC**
   - Create roles: admin, operator, viewer
   - Restrict actions by role
   - Audit all changes

4. **Secure Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Use secret management service
   # Never commit credentials
   # Rotate API keys regularly
   export GROQ_API_KEY="sk-xxxx"
   export DB_PASSWORD="xxxx"
   ```

5. **Network Isolation**
   ```yaml
   # Use VPC/private networks
   # Restrict inbound traffic
   # Use firewall rules
   ```

6. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Enable audit logs
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts for failures
